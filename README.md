Our community is still predominantly Hawaiian. Hana has a rich history and the Hawaiian population in this area once numbered in the hundreds of thousands. Today Hana's population is under 2000, from Keanae to Kaupo, a 40-mile coastal radius. Hana Kai is centrally located and easily accessible. The property is nestled along the North side of Hana Bay at the entrance to Waikaloa Beach. Although we do not recommend swimming (except on very calm days), Waikaloa Beach is wonderful to explore and you can actually walk for several miles on the coastal trail to Waianapanapa State park. Hana Bay is a precious resource to the community and you may see fisherman netting Akule, keiki swimming in the gentle shore break at Hana Bay, dolphins and sometimes whales, turtles along the rocks or canoe paddlers practicing for an upcoming regatta.                                                                                                                         | https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/134e34b0-f332-46ae-968a-825abadb061a.jpg                                                   |  17299715 | https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/17299715  | Susie (General Manager)     | 2014-06-26   | Hāna, HI              | I am the General Manager for Hana Kai.

**On data cleaning: Remove duplicate values from the data. and then handle missing values, Remove columns with more than 50% missing values and fill missing values in numeric columns.Here is the code:**
```
import pandas as pd

# Load the CSV file
file_path = 'data/listings.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# 1. Remove duplicate rows
df_cleaned = df.drop_duplicates()

# 2. Handle missing values
# Remove columns with more than 50% missing values
missing_values = df_cleaned.isnull().mean().sort_values(ascending=False)
columns_to_drop = missing_values[missing_values > 0.5].index
df_cleaned = df_cleaned.drop(columns=columns_to_drop)

# Fill missing values in numeric columns
numeric_columns = ['review_scores_value', 'review_scores_checkin', 'review_scores_location',
'review_scores_communication', 'review_scores_cleanliness']

for col in numeric_columns:
median_value = df_cleaned[col].median()
df_cleaned[col] = df_cleaned[col].fillna(median_value)

# Save the cleaned data to a new CSV file
df_cleaned.to_csv('data/listings_clean.csv', index=False)

```

## 1、show exactly two documents from the listings collection in any order
```
db.listings.find().limit(2);
```

```
